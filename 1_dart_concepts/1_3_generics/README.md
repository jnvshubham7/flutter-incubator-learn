Step 1.3: Generics
==================

**Estimated time**: 1 day

[Generics][1] represent the main form of [parametric polymorphism][2] in [Dart], allowing a single piece of code to be given a "generic" type, using variables in place of actual types, and then instantiated with particular types as needed.

> Generic types can save you the trouble of creating all these interfaces. Instead, you can create a single interface that takes a type parameter:
> ```dart
> abstract class Cache<T> {
>   T getByKey(String key);
>   void setByKey(String key, T value);
> }
> ```
> In this code, `T` is the stand-in type. Itâ€™s a placeholder that you can think of as a type that a developer will define later.

For better understanding of [generics][3] design in [Dart], their benefits and use-cases, read through the following articles:
- [Dart Docs: Generics][3]
- [Dart Tutorial: Dart Generics][4]
- [Monty Rasmussen: Generics in Dart and Flutter][5]
- [Shaiq Khan: Explore Generics In Dart & Flutter][6]




## Task

Implement a method, returning the maximum element from a `Comparable` list. You must use [generics][3] to allow different types usage with that method.




## Questions

After completing everything above, you should be able to answer (and understand why) the following questions:
- What are generics in [Dart]? Why are they useful?
- What is a type parameter? How can a type parameter be constrained?

### Questions

#### Q1: What are generics in [Dart]? Why are they useful?

A1: Generics in Dart represent the main form of parametric polymorphism, allowing a single piece of code to be given a "generic" type, using variables in place of actual types, and then instantiated with particular types as needed. They are useful because they can save you the trouble of creating multiple interfaces and classes for different types, instead allowing you to create a single interface or class that can work with multiple types.

#### Q2: What is a type parameter? How can a type parameter be constrained?

A2: A type parameter is a placeholder for a type that will be defined later. In the example of `abstract class Cache<T>`, `T` is a type parameter. A type parameter can be constrained by specifies a set of possible types that the type parameter can be. For example, in the `Cache<K, V>` class, `K` and `V` are type parameters that can be constrained to extend `Comparable`.
