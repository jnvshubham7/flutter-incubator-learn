void main() {
  // Implement a method, returning the maximum element from a `Comparable` list.
  // You must use generics to allow different types usage with that method.
}


Here is the full code for the task:

```java
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Implement a method, returning the maximum element from a `Comparable` list.
        // You must use generics to allow different types usage with that method.
        Comparable maxElement = findMax(Collections.emptyList());
        System.out.println(maxElement);
    }

    public static <T extends Comparable<T>> T findMax(List<T> list) {
        if (list.isEmpty()) {
            throw new RuntimeException("The list is empty!");
        }
        T maxValue = list.get(0);
        for (T value : list) {
            if (value.compareTo(maxValue) > 0) {
                maxValue = value;
            }
        }
        return maxValue;
    }
}
```

In this code, we're creating a generic method `findMax` which takes a list of type `T` as its parameter. `T` must extend `Comparable`. This means that any class that wants to be used as the type `T` must implement the `Comparable` interface.

This method checks if the list is empty, and if it is, throws a `RuntimeException`. If the list is not empty, it sets the initial maximum value to the first value in the list. Then, it iterates through the list, and if it finds a value that is greater than the current maximum, it updates the maximum.

Finally, we're calling `findMax` method in the `main` method with an empty list of `String` objects.
